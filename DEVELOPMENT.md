# Plan
I'm spending more time on this than just hacking it out because I'm having fun getting back into the code.

Build a command line client, use stdlib opt parser.
Use the API doc api client code but clean it up.
Separate the api client from the app with small domain objects.
Have fun making a web client from it.

- [ ] Command line runs via /bin/reporter
- [ ] Happy path spits out basic report.
- [ ] Happy path spits out "average"
- [ ] --credentials (Maybe)
- [ ] --ignore-donuts
- [ ] --ignore-cc-payments
- [ ] --crystal-ball
